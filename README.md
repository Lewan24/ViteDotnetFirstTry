Simple example of dotnet api and vite react web ui

UI is generated by figma for university project as the example of app ui.
I used it to test how easly it is to move project from figma to ready application.

I used this and created a simple C# API project to test communication between api and web. Api is generating random number and web shows it as totalBackupsCount.

Running project is simple, you need to run 2 commands:<br>
from backend directory
```bash
dotnet run
```
from frontend directory
```bash
npm run dev
```
